# Haskell-Calculator for linear equation systems
created at [munihac2016](http://www.munihac.de) as a beginner project
## How-To use
just fire up `stack ghci` and insert your linear equation like this:
```
give me your matrix!
1 1 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
whats the result-Vector?
3 3 6
result:[0.0,3.0,6.0]
```
Since this is a small, simple project i thought it might help Haskell beginners understand how a haskell-project is structured and what tools to use.
